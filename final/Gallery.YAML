  Our project is a multi-mode wordle in the terminal where a user interface 
  would be utilized to navigate between the gamemode selections through interactive
  features such as, but not limited to, main menu screens and pop-up messages. 
  From the previous plan of working on simply a selection of arbitrary games, 
  a multi-option wordle allow us to utilize additional features that would 
  immerse the user in a more effective experience when interacting with our system 
  and navigating through the gamemode selection process. Our wordle comes in 
  different modes like timed mode where the user have to guess the word in a 
  certian amount of time (30s 60s or 120s) or untimed. You can also guess words
  of different lengths. You can also choose the difficulty that you want to play
  in and based on that the number of attempts you get per word. During the game, 
  you can also get hints about the words you are trying to guess or rather giveup
  and quit the game. The game also keeps your score to know if you are getting better
  or not across all modes.
